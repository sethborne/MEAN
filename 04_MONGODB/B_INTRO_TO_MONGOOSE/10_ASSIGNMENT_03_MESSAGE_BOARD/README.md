# Assignment: Message Board

For this assignment, you will create a simple single page message board that allows users to create messages, and comment on existing messages. Follow the wireframe below:

1. ~~Make sure all the forms validate for presence~~
2. ~~Make sure the name field contains no less than 4 characters~~
3. ~~Have only 2 folders within your main project folder, 'views' and 'node_modules'~~
4. ~~Put all models and controllers within your server.js~~
5. ~~When the page loads, it will load all of the messages and all of the comments for each message.~~
