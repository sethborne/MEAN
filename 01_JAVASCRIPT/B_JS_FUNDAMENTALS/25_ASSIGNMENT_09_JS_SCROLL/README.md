# Optional Assignment: JavaScript Scroll

Fix the following runtime errors from the example code:

~~• The last character of each string in the words array doesn't show up.~~

~~• The blank spaces are not appearing correctly. The cursor does not correctly shift to the right on blank spaces, instead it pauses on the previous letter and jumps to the next letter.~~

### Hint

When you work with code, not all the time will you be working with code that you wrote from scratch. Oftentimes, you'll need to be able to dive into and understand an unfamiliar codebase. Do not feel like you need to write code like this from scratch yet. This assignment is designed to challenge you to understand and debug a couple runtime errors.

Also, consider looking up the setInterval function. It might be easier to debug this by slowing the interval down.
